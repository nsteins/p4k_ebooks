Python code to generate sesquipedalian reviews of fictional albums and post them to twitter. View results @ http://twitter.com/p4k_ebooks

This is a simple twitter bot that uses mad-libs type templates and a few dictionaries of silly genre names or unnecessarily long verbiage along to create album reviews. It also downloads a random flickr image and applies some simple filters to create an album cover with the band name being selected from a random wikipedia page. 

All around, a pretty silly project
