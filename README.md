Python code to generate sesquipedalian reviews of fictional albums and post them to twitter. View results @ http://twitter.com/p4k_ebooks

This is a simple twitter bot that uses mad-libs type templates and a few dictionaries of silly genre names or unnecessarily long verbiage along to create album reviews. It also downloads a random flickr image and applies some simple filters to create an album cover with the band name being selected from a random wikipedia page. 

code to download and glitch images copied and modified from Chris Cuellar's tutorial which is available at http://blog.art21.org/2011/09/20/how-to-use-python-to-create-a-simple-flickr-photo-glitcher/#.VcgaF3UVhBc

All around, a pretty silly project
